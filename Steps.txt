WARNING: Running pip as the 'root' user can result in broken permissions and conflicting behaviour with the system package manager. 
It is recommended to use a virtual environment instead: https://pip.pypa.io/warnings/venv

Install virtualenv using pip: First, ensure pip is installed
**yum install python3-pip**

then install virtualenv:
**pip3 install virtualenv**

Create a virtual environment:
**virtualenv myenv(name)**

Activate the virtual environment:
**source myenv/bin/activate**

then install pyroute2:
**pip3 install pyroute2**

Ensure that IP forwarding is enabled on VM 2 so that it can route packets between the two networks:
**sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1**

**sudo ip route delete 172.168.3.0/24 dev ens160**
