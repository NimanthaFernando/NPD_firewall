# Custom Linux-Based Firewall with Interface-Level Logging & WireGuard VPN

## Introduction

This project is a custom-built Linux firewall designed for secure and efficient network traffic control. It provides **interface-level logging**, **packet inspection**, and supports **encrypted VPN communication** using WireGuard. The firewall was developed using **Python** and **Bash scripting** to automate traffic management and log collection, offering a balance between performance and flexibility.

Whether managing internal segments or allowing encrypted remote access, this firewall offers transparency and control with real-time logging and rule-based filtering.
